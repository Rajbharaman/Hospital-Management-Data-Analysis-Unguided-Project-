# Hospital-Management-Data-Analysis-Unguided-Project-

Hospital Management
Purpose: Analyze hospital data to track patient records, evaluate healthcare metrics, and identify areas for improvement.

Description: Hospital management involves handling vast amounts of data related to patient care. 
In this project, you will work with a hospital dataset that includes patient demographics, medical procedures, and healthcare performance metrics. 
Using SQL, you will analyze patient records, evaluate healthcare metrics,identify areas for improvement such as reducing wait times or optimizing resource allocation, 
and make data-driven recommendations for enhancing hospital management. This project highlights your ability to leverage data analysis for improving healthcare outcomes.
